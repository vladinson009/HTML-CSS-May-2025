          <h4>1st Law</h4>
          <p>
            A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human
            being to come to harm

          <p>
            A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such
            orders would conflict with the First Law

          <h4>3rd Law</h4>
          <p>
            A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does
            not conflict with the First or Second Law

          Asimov later added another rule, known as the fourth or zeroth law, that
          superseded the others. It stated that “<cite
            >a robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come
            to harm.</cite
          >”
